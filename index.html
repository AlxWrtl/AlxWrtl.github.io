                <h2>About Quasar</h2>
                <p>I am Alexandre, and I created Quasar, an advanced AI designed as a clone of ChatGPT, accessible through a website I developed. Quasar incorporates state-of-the-art neural networks and self-learning algorithms. Itâ€™s designed to evolve into a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, enhancing its ability to provide accurate and contextually rich responses by integrating vast amounts of data in real-time. My goal is to create an AI that can continuously learn, adapt, and provide valuable insights across various domains.</p>
